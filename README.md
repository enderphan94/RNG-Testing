# RNG-Testing
I've found it wacky when doing the RNG testing, with fewer documents, and less expertise.. thus, wanted to wrap something up for later uses.

# Intro
I've done for UK, Denmark, Sweden, Malta jurisdiction. Dieharder and NIST, Chi-squares tests are mostly wanted. I was struggling so badly when I first doing this, I'm a Security Engineer based so gotta do some math and try to understand the whole concept of the those tests, the p values and so on.

I urge you to read the documents carefully and precisely, otherwise, you might miss and do it wrong during the examination.

**NIST:** https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf

**Chi-square:** I'm using R-studio or matlab (https://statsandr.com/blog/chi-square-test-of-independence-in-r/) and (https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/chi2gof.html)
